# dotfiles

### Set them up using `stow`

To set up all dotfiles, navigate to the `config/` directory and use the following command: 
```
stow -t ~ *
```
To set up a particular doftile (say `zathura`): 
```
stow -t ~ zathura
```

*Note:* I got this statusbar from [adi1090x's repository](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes).
